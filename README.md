## Project Overview

W. Avy, my customer, wants more information about temperature trends before opening a surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results

December had the lowest recorded temperature. The lowest record temperature in June was 64, while the lowest record temperature in Decemeber was 56.

June had the highest max temperature. The max temperature for June was 85, and the max temperature for December was 83.

The standard deviation for December is higher than July. The standard deviation for December was 3.75, while the standard deviation for June was 3.26.


## Summary

I believe that a surf and ice cream shop would be sustainable year-round, because average temperature between June and December are almost identical. Also, most of the statistical summary for both months are very similar. I would recommend creating an additional query of the precipitation data and compare both months. This information would be helpful because not only is ice cream best served on non rainy days, so would the conditions for surfing. When both conditions are not bad then W. Avy would be able to attract the most customers. I would also creating a query showing the results of different stations' precipitation data. This would provide W. Avy the location with the least amount of rainfall to bring in most customers for both ice cream and surfing.
